# Web_Based_List.

This is a project I took up while working as an intern at Mar&Mor Engineering services last year (2019), I worked as an electrical engineering 
intern. One day while talking with the head of the IT department, he told me about how it would be nice to have an online list of 
equipments and their prices, so everyone working in the firm could have access to them. So I decided to build one, even if it doesn't
get deployed it would be something fun to work on.

# AIM.
The aim of the project is to build an online list of equipments, specifications, and their prices so everyone working in the firm could have access. 
You would have to register as a user on the web platform to input anything, you could change the price of an equipment someone else uploaded assuming you are aware that price and specification of that equipment has changed and the person who initially uploaded it doesn't, of course it would be shown that you had made some changes. You could also change your password incase forgotten.

# Tools.
I used HTML, CSS and BOOTSTRAP for the front end.
I used the django web frame work for the backend.
In the case of deployment I created a postgres database. Although, while working on the site I used the sqlite that comes with django.

# Slight drawbacks
The front end is not aesthetically pleasing, hence I am improving on my front-end skills by working on my html and css and also
adding javascript to it.



I would like to note that this is a project I started few months to the end of the year 2019 and
finished two weeks into the year 2020.
